Note from Jenny Sabin:

"Attached, are two files. One is the component as a Rhino file. This should
be opened within Rhino and then set to the 'curve' battery in grasshopper. I
made some notes in the GH file. One definition shows how to set up a
variegated grid through a python script. The other is a regular grid w/
sliders. This should give the students a couple of stepping stones to start
instantiating their own components into larger swaths, etc. For 3D
components, they will need two grids. Please encourage them to download the
paneling tools plug-in. They will need it w/ the attached definition.
There's a lot that can be done w/ some simple definitions.
With a bit of python fun, they can really take off w/ much more informed
behavioral organizations."
